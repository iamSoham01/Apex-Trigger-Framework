Config-Driven (Custom Metadata) Framework

📌 Overview
Trigger execution and handler mapping is driven by Custom Metadata Types (CMDT). Enables logic execution based on org-configurable data rather than hardcoded mappings.

✅ Advantages

1. Highly flexible and declarative
2. Great for ISVs or managed packages
3. New handlers can be added without code changes
4. Promotes clean separation between platform logic and configuration

❌ Disadvantages

1. Slightly complex to build and debug
2. Requires careful versioning and metadata management
3. Runtime errors possible if configuration is incomplete
