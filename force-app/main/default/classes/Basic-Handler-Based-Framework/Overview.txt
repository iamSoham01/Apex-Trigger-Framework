Basic Handler-Based Framework

📌 Overview
A simple structure where the trigger delegates logic to a corresponding handler class. The logic is split per trigger event (before insert, after update, etc.).

✅ Advantages
1. Easy to implement and understand
2. Centralizes logic away from the trigger file
3. Keeps trigger code clean

❌ Disadvantages

1. Does not scale well in large orgs
2. Difficult to manage cross-object logic
3. Recursion handling and extensibility are limited
4. No abstraction for reusable logic (e.g., for multiple SObjects)
