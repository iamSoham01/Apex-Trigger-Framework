Switch-Based Dispatcher Framework

📌 Overview
Introduces a dispatcher or controller that determines the trigger context (like before insert, after update) and calls domain-specific logic. Typically involves an event switch or enum.

✅ Advantages

1. Centralized control over trigger context
2. Cleaner separation of trigger phases and business logic
3. Easier to manage logic evolution

❌ Disadvantages

1. Requires manual mapping of events
2. Becomes bulky if not modularized
3. No native support for configuration-driven execution
