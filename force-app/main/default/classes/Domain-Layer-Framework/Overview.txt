📌 Overview
Each SObject has its own domain class that encapsulates business rules and data manipulations, invoked by a dispatcher.

✅ Advantages

1. Enforces Single Responsibility Principle
2. Promotes unit testing and domain-driven design
3. High cohesion, easier maintainability

❌ Disadvantages

1. Boilerplate code increases with number of objects
2. Still manual if not enhanced with metadata/configuration
3. Can lead to tight coupling if not carefully designed
