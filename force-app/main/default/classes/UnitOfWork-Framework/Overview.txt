Unit of Work (UOW) Pattern-Based Framework

📌 Overview
Applies a UOW object to register logic handlers (services) and defer execution of logic and DML until all processing is done.

✅ Advantages

1. Excellent control over DML and side-effects
2. Useful in highly interconnected logic (e.g., multi-object orchestration)
3. Ensures consistent transaction handling

❌ Disadvantages

1. Complex to understand and implement
2. Overhead not needed for simple use cases
3. Can introduce rigidity if misused
