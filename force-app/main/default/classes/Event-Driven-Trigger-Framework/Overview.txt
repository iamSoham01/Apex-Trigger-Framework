Event-Driven / Platform Event Based Framework

📌 Overview
Trigger logic is decoupled by publishing Platform Events or Change Data Capture events, and logic is handled asynchronously in subscribers.

✅ Advantages

1. Great for loosely coupled, async workflows
2. Scales better across systems (esp. integrations)
3. Improves UI responsiveness

❌ Disadvantages

1. Higher latency (due to async nature)
2. Not suitable for synchronous data validation
3. Error handling requires more design
